Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -pedantic -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -pedantic -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o
rm cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -pedantic -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step3.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step3 cyoa-step3.o
rm cyoa-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -pedantic -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step4.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step4 cyoa-step4.o
rm cyoa-step4.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------


4.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 goodstory4  <  goodstory4/input1.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
